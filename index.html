<p style="font-family:algeriam">
    A nebula is a giant interstellar cloud of dust and hydrogen, helium, and other ionised gases in space.
     Some of them come when a dying star (such as a supernova) throws out gas and dust due to an explosion. 
     There are some nebulae (more than one nebula) that are present where new stars are beginning to form
      because of which, they are sometimes also referred to as “star nurseries”.A nebula is a truly wondrous thing to behold. Named after the
      Latin word for “cloud”, nebulae are not only massive
      clouds of dust, hydrogen and helium gas,
      and plasma; they are also often “stellar nurseries”
      – i.e. the place where stars are born. And for
      centuries, distant galaxies were often mistaken for these massive clouds.
      Alas, such descriptions barely scratch the surface of what nebulae are and what
      there significance is.
      Between their formation process, their role in stellar and planetary formation, and their diversity, nebulae
      have provided humanity with endless intrigue and discovery.
      For some time now, scientists and astronomers have been aware that outer space is not really a
      total vacuum. In fact, it is made up of gas and dust particles known collectively as the Interstellar Medium (ISM).
      Approximately 99% of the ISM is composed of gas, while about 75% of its mass takes the form of hydrogen and the remaining 25% as helium.
