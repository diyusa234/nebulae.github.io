              <p style="font-family:Bell MT;font-size: 20;"align =left> <b>Nebula: What Are They And Where Do They Come From?</b><br>
A nebula is a truly wondrous thing to behold. Named after the<br>
Latin word for “cloud”, nebulae are not only massive <br>clouds of dust, hydrogen and helium gas,<br>
 and plasma; they are also often “stellar nurseries”<br> – i.e. the place where stars are born. And for <br>
 centuries, distant galaxies were often mistaken for these massive clouds.<br>

Alas, such descriptions barely scratch the surface of what nebulae are and what <br>there significance is.<br>
 Between their formation process, their role in stellar and planetary formation, and their diversity, nebulae<br>
  have provided humanity with endless intrigue and discovery.<br>


For some time now, scientists and astronomers have been aware that outer space is not really a <br>
total vacuum. In fact, it is made up of gas and dust particles known collectively as the Interstellar Medium (ISM). <br>
Approximately 99% of the ISM is composed of gas, while about 75% of its mass takes the form of hydrogen and the remaining 25% as helium.
Many nebulous objects were noticed in the night sky by astronomers during Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages. <br>
The first recorded observation took place in 150 CE, when Ptolemy noted the presence of five stars in Almagast that appeared nebulous in his book.<br>
 He also noted a region of luminosity between the constellations Ursa Major and Leo that was not associated with any observable star.<br>

 By the 17th century, improvements in telescopes led to the first confirmed observations of nebulae. This began in 1610, when French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc made the first recorded observation of the Orion Nebula. In 1618, Swiss astronomer Johann Baptist Cysat also observed the nebula; and by 1659, Christiaan Huygens made the first detailed study of it.

 By the 18th century, the number of observed nebulae began to increase and astronomers began to compile lists. In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae – M11, M13, M22, M31, M42, and the Omega Centauri globular cluster (NGC 5139) – in his “An account of several nebulae or lucid spots like clouds, lately discovered among the fixt stars by help of the telescope.”

 In 1746, French astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux compiled a list of 20 nebulae, included eight that were not previously known. Between 1751 and 53, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope, most of which were previously unknown. And in 1781, Charles Messier compiled his catalog of 103 “nebulae” (now called Messier objects),
  though some were galaxies and comets.
 
 The number of observed and cataloged nebulae greatly expanded thanks to the efforts of William Herschel and his sister, Caroline. In 1786, the two published their Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, which was followed up in 1786 and 1802 by a second and third catalog. At the time, Herschel believed that these nebulae were merely unresolved clusters of stars, a belief he would amend in 1790 when he observed a true nebula surrounding a distant star.
